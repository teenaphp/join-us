## The real stuff.
 1. Which all programming languages are installed on your system.
    
    PHP
 
 2. Write a function that takes a number and returns an array of its digits.
 
    number.toString().length() 
 
 3. Write function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back. English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’. “Join with storybox” becomes “oinjay ithway toryboxsay”.
 
    Pigify(word)
 
 
 4. Write a function that rotates an array by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. Try solving this without creating a copy of the array.
